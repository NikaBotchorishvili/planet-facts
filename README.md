## My process

My process with this project went like this: I created individual components such as : header, planet; as I was splitting them into their 
own individual components. I also priorited the responsiveness from the get go.  I changed some application design structure in the 
process, for example when I was starting out I tried using Context API but I soon found out that it was a dumb decision cause using React 
Router with loader functions gives a much simpler solution in this particular application.

### Built with

- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - JS library
 
### What I learned

In this project I learned how to use React Router and got a little comfortable with it
